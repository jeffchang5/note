## Clean Code
### Discussion points
* Comments exist for when code fails to express the intention.
* Good code can enforce the rules through logic rather than in comments.
* Comments don't replace good code.

### Structuring Code
* It's often easier to write intention through the code through proper function names and abstractions.
* Have larger abstractions to demonstrate behavior.
* When using an API owned by another party. Can use comments to clarify behavior.

### When to Write Comments
* Explanation of intent is sometimes justified for writing comments.
* **Amplification** - should document why an operation or behavior is needed.

### Bad Comments
* Comments should be readable and articulate. Clearly demonstrate intent.
* Comments should communicate other parts of the system where behavior arises.
* Comments should not be redundant from the code.
* Subtle misleading comments can make it difficult to develop.
* Non-local information. Comments detailing other parts of the system are risky as they provide documentation that may not be updated.
* Comment should be able to express their own meaning without too much additional information. No additional connections without explanation.

### Others
* **TODOS** are not an excuse to leave bad code.
* Don't write JavaDocs for non-public APIs.
